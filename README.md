# WonderCard
Experience the magic of celebration beyond the photos

## About the project
A project created for DubHacks 2020. This web app lets you create wonderful cards/images that can come to life
when scanned. This project has two aspects to it. When out webapp is opened on a desktop it will display
a different feature to the user and when the webapp is opened on a mobile device it will display another
feature. The two features are listed below along with which device they can be viewed on.

* Ability to connect a card/image to a beautiful video message (only available on a desktop)
* Ability to view a video message by scanning a card (only available on a smartphone)

## Inspiration
Sometimes cards can lack the depth needed to describe your emotions. That's where WonderCard kicks it. It's a way for people to add more depth to their holiday cards to express themselves in a more complete manner.

## What it does
Our web app, when accessed on a desktop, allows you to create an experience for your holiday cards or images by connecting them to a meaningful video. You simply take the image and upload it alongside the video you'd like to attach.
When our web app is accessed from a mobile device the recipient of your card can scan it through their phone and watch the video you intended for them to see.

## How we built it
We build our frontend using HTML, CSS, and JS. The models and connections between our models and images are done through EchoAR.

## Challenges we ran into
* Hacking in a covid-filled virrtualll worlddd
* Lots of trial and error to understand how Echo AR prefers the models to be
* Minor UI formatting challenges

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Finishing a working solution
* Having a user-focused UI solution

## What we learned
* AR projects can seem daunting but under the right toolset can be accomplished

## What's next for WonderCard
* Improved stability for videos
* Scaling to support more cards and videos
